# Capstone Project
Project on Recommendation Engine
1.	Problem Statement
When we plan to buy a book specially the scientific books, we normally ask about the goods ones, research the book domains, compare the books with similar or read the reviews so here the recommender system is the master of this problem. This will help readers to find relevant book according to their interest/taste.

The basic idea behind analyzing the Goodreads dataset is to get a fair idea about the relationships between the multiple attributes a book might have, such as: the aggregate rating of each book, the trend of the authors over the years and books with numerous languages. With over a hundred thousand ratings, there are books which just tend to become popular as each day seems to pass.
We've always considered the magical persona books seem to hold, and with this notebook, we step out on a journey to see what kind of books really drives people to read in this era of modern smart devices.

Dataset is also attached with the code however you can find the dataset on Kaggle as well:
